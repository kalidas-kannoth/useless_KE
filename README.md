# Emotional Snake üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Script Squad


### Team Members
- Member 1: kalidas k - Albertain Institute of science and technology.

### Project Description
The Emotional Snake Game is a fun and creative twist on the classic Snake game, designed using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Unlike traditional versions, this snake has emotions ‚Äî it gets depressed if it doesn't find an apple within 15 seconds! The snake‚Äôs mood affects gameplay, including delayed responses and random sad quotes in Malayalam/English, adding a humorous and relatable touch.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The classic snake game is fun, but emotionally flat. What if the snake had feelings ‚Äî got depressed without apples, ignored your controls, and dropped sad Malayalam quotes?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Build a snake that gets emotionally unstable if it doesn‚Äôt eat in time. It slows down, ignores input, shows funny quotes, and ends the game if sadness goes too far ‚Äî adding humor and personality to a classic game.
